## Lunch Break Coding Challenge - Week 2, Day 1

This project is part of my 4-week coding challenge that I'm completing during my lunch breaks using just my iPad and GitHub Codespaces. The challenge focuses on building progressive web development skills through small, daily tasks.

## Project Overview

This simple counter application demonstrates basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript. The app features:
- A numerical display that shows the current count
- An increment button that increases the count value
- Clean, responsive styling

## Challenge Context

- **Week 2**: Document Object Model (DOM) & User Interface (UI) Interactions
- **Day 1 Task**: Create a counter button that updates a number display

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Codespaces (development environment)

## iPad + Codespaces Development

This entire project was built during my lunch break using only an iPad and GitHub Codespaces. Codespaces provides a complete development environment in the browser, making it possible to code anywhere without needing a traditional development setup.

### Development Process

1. Created the project structure in Codespaces
2. Built the HTML structure for the counter
3. Implemented JavaScript functionality to handle state changes
4. Added CSS styling for a clean, responsive interface

## Future Enhancements

As the 4-week challenge progresses, I plan to:
- Add decrement functionality
- Implement a reset button
- Add animation effects when the counter changes
- Possibly save the counter state using localStorage

## Running the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view and interact with the counter.
